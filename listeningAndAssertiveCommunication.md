**What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?**

    1. Avoid getting distracted by your own thoughts. Focus on the speaker and topic instead.
    2. Try not to interrupt the other person. Let them finish and then respond.
    3. Use door openers. These are phrases that show your are interested and keep the other person talking.
    4. Show that you are listening with body language.
    5. If appropriate take notes during important conversations.
    6. Paraphrase what other have said to make sure you are on the same page.

**According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?**

    The key points of Reflective Listening include:

    **Empathy**: Show genuine empathy and understanding towards the speaker's feelings and emotions. Put yourself in their shoes and try to see the situation from their perspective.

    **Active Listening**: Pay full attention to the speaker, maintain eye contact, and provide verbal and non-verbal cues to indicate that you are fully engaged in the conversation.

    **Paraphrasing**: Summarize the speaker's words and feelings in your own words. This shows that you are actively processing the information and helps the speaker feel heard and validated.

    **Nonjudgmental Approach**: Avoid passing judgment or providing unsolicited advice. Reflective Listening is about creating a safe space for the speaker to express themselves without fear of criticism.

    **Clarification**: Seek clarification if something is unclear or ambiguous. This demonstrates your commitment to understanding the speaker's message accurately.

    **Validation**: Acknowledge the speaker's emotions and experiences, even if you don't necessarily agree with them. Validation helps build rapport and trust in the conversation.

    **Silence**: Allow moments of silence to give the speaker time to gather their thoughts or process their emotions. Avoid interrupting or rushing the conversation.

    Reflective Listening is a valuable skill not only in therapeutic settings but also in everyday communication to improve relationships, resolve conflicts, and foster a deeper understanding of others. If Fisher's model of Reflective Listening has emerged after my last update, I recommend looking for more up-to-date sources to gain a better understanding of it.

**What are the obstacles in your listening process?**

    **Distractions**: Sometimes, I find it challenging to focus on what someone is saying when there are distractions around me, like background noise or other activities happening nearby. It's tough to concentrate on their message when my attention keeps getting pulled away.

    **Prejudice and Bias**: I admit that my preconceived notions and biases can sometimes cloud my ability to truly understand the speaker's message. If I have pre-existing beliefs about the topic or the person talking, it can influence how I interpret their words.

    **Lack of Interest**: When I'm not interested in the subject or don't find the speaker engaging, it's difficult to stay fully attentive. My mind tends to wander, and I may unintentionally zone out.

    **Emotional State**: If I'm feeling stressed, upset, or anxious, it's harder for me to be a good listener. My emotions can interfere with my ability to process what the speaker is saying.

    **Information Overload**: There are times when I feel overwhelmed by the amount of information being conveyed. When there's too much to take in, I struggle to retain important details.

    **Cultural Differences**: I sometimes encounter communication barriers due to cultural differences. Different languages, customs, or communication styles can lead to misunderstandings.

    **Listening to Respond, Not Understand**: I catch myself sometimes formulating my response while the other person is still talking. Instead of fully understanding their perspective, I'm focused on what I want to say next.

    **Lack of Empathy**: It's not always easy for me to put myself in the speaker's shoes and truly understand their emotions and feelings. Sometimes, I may unintentionally come across    as unsympathetic.

    **Technical Jargon**: If the speaker uses complex terms or jargon that I'm not familiar with, I struggle to grasp the full meaning of their message.

    **Interruptions**: When conversations are filled with interruptions, either from me or the other person, it disrupts the flow of communication and makes it difficult to follow the discussion.

    **Assumptions**: I've noticed that I sometimes make assumptions about what the speaker is going to say before they finish their sentence, leading to misunderstandings.

    **Physical Barriers**: If there are physical barriers between me and the speaker, like distance or poor acoustics, it can be challenging to hear and understand them clearly.

    Being aware of these obstacles helps me work on my listening skills, and I strive to become a more attentive and understanding communicator.

**What can you do to improve your listening?**

    **Be Present**: I need to remind myself to be fully present during conversations. I'll consciously avoid distractions and focus my attention on the speaker.

    **Maintain Eye Contact**: When someone is talking to me, I'll make an effort to maintain eye contact. It shows them that I'm actively engaged and attentive.

    **Avoid Interrupting**: I'll work on being patient and letting the speaker finish their thoughts before I respond. Interrupting can be rude and disrupt the flow of communication.

    **Practice Active Listening**: I'll practice active listening by summarizing or paraphrasing what the speaker is saying. It will help me ensure that I understand their message accurately.

    **Be Open-Minded**: I'll approach conversations with an open mind, setting aside any preconceived notions or biases I might have.

    **Control Your Emotions**: I'll try to manage my emotions during conversations, especially when discussing sensitive topics. Emotions can cloud my ability to listen effectively.

    **Ask Clarifying Questions**: If I don't understand something, I'll ask for clarification. It shows that I genuinely want to comprehend their perspective.

    **Empathize**: I'll put myself in the speaker's shoes and try to understand their feelings and emotions behind their words.

    **Be Patient**: I'll be patient and give the speaker the time they need to express themselves fully. Rushing the conversation can lead to misunderstandings.

    **Practice Mindfulness**: Developing mindfulness techniques will help me stay focused and attentive during discussions.

    **Reduce Multitasking**: I'll avoid multitasking while listening to someone. It's essential to give them my undivided attention.

    **Learn to Listen to Understand, Not Just Respond:** Instead of immediately formulating responses, I'll train myself to listen to understand the speaker's message fully.

    **Improve My Vocabulary**: Expanding my vocabulary will enable me to grasp complex or technical terms used by the speaker.

    **Seek Feedback**: I'll actively seek feedback from others on my listening skills. Constructive criticism can help me identify areas for improvement.

    **Practice Empathetic Listening**: I'll strive to not only comprehend what the speaker is saying but also empathize with their emotions and intentions behind their words.

    Improving my listening skills is an ongoing journey, but I believe it will greatly enhance my communication and strengthen my relationships with others.
