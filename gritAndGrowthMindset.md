    Mindsets have two main categories: 
    the fixed mindset and the growth mindset. 
    The fixed mindset suggests that skills and intelligence are predetermined – you either have them or you don't. 
    The growth mindset, on the other hand, believes that skills can be cultivated and developed through effort.

    These mindsets profoundly influence our learning capabilities. 
    Studies have shown that those with a growth mindset tend to achieve more, learn better, and grow over time compared to their fixed mindset people. 
    This concept's impact is so profound that companies, sports teams etc are embracing it as part of their culture.

    Defining traits of these mindsets: belief and focus. 
    Those with a fixed mindset see effort negatively and don't consider it valuable. 
    people with a growth mindset recognize the importance of effort in the learning process. 
    Fixed mindset individuals focus on outcomes and appearances, while those with a growth mindset concentrate on the process of improvement.

    Four crucial elements drive growth: effort, challenges, mistakes, and feedback. 
    Individuals with a fixed mindset tend to shy away from these elements, perceiving them as threats to their innate abilities. 
    However, the growth mindset thrives on these aspects, understanding that effort, challenges, mistakes, and feedback are integral to personal development.

    Depending on the situation, we may lean towards either the fixed or growth mindset. Understanding our mindset and its driving factors – belief or focus – is crucial.

**What is the Internal Locus of Control? What is the key point in the video?**
    Internal locus of control is when I believe that what happens in my life is mostly because of the things I do and the choices I make. 
    When I have an internal locus of control, I feel like I can shape my future by how I act and the decisions I take. 
    This idea comes up a lot when people talk about getting better, staying motivated, and feeling confident in myself. 
    it is very important for me to take charge of my actions and feel like I have control over what happens in my life.

    1. "Locus of control" is about believing in control over life's outcomes.
    2. Praised-for-intelligence students had external locus of control, credited success to external factors.
    3. Praised-for-effort students had internal locus of control, saw hard work as key to success.
    4. Internal locus of control is important for long-term motivation.
    5. In door-to-door sales, external-blamers lacked motivation, internal-takers persisted.
    6. To adopt internal locus of control: solve problems, acknowledge positive outcomes from actions.
    7. Believing in control of destiny leads to lasting motivation.
    8. Mindset shift influences how I face challenges and stay motivated.
